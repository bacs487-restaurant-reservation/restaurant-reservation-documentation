# First Group Meeting
- We got together and started out by creating a digital ocean account (for our server and our database)
- Currently have an ubuntu server/droplet running along with a database.
- We set up a password so that everyone can access and get to the server with out having to use SSH keys. Instead of SSH keys, we just ssh root@ our server ip
- From there we created a superuser account so that we can all be logged into it. 
- Since this is our first meeting, almost all of us had the exact same task which was just getting connected to the server.
# Plan from here:
- we will set up our database and create tables so that we can implement the API after that. 
- we will push things to GitHub and then pull them down and load them onto the server
