# Group meeting
- Today we finished setting up our server. Docker Compose and docker are now set up and ready to go.
- As a team we decided on a "home page" for our app so we are all on the same page.
- plan is to set up and figure out docker hub which is where we will push our API and other components
- from there, we will pull things down from dockerhub and they will be deployed on our server so that it can run
- Doug and Jacob will finish setting up API endpoints and adding final tables to our DB. 
- Jessica and Emmanuel will continue to work on the ui of the app and start messing around with React. Goal is to make some dummy apps and implement some of the ideas/pieces that we want to include on our project.
